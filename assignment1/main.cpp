 * This function should populate the `courses` vector with structs of type

 * file, where each line is a record!
 *
 * Hints:
 * 1) Take a look at the split function we provide in utils.cpp
 * 2) Each LINE is a record! *this is important, so we're saying it again :>)*
 * 3) The first line in the CSV defines the column names, so you can ignore it!
 *
 * @param filename The name of the file to parse.
 * @param courses  A vector of courses to populate.

 * 2) Use the delete_elem_from_vector function we give you!
 * 3) Remember to write the CSV column headers at the beginning of the output!
